    <h1>JS Extra Class Day-1</h1>
    <h3>Q1. What is Javascript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Javascript is an interpreter language that means where our code is going  to run line by line.</li>
        <li>Javascript is a scripting language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.</li>
        <li>JavaScript can update and make changes in both HTML and CSS.</li>
        <li>It is a combination of both the complier and interpreter.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Q2. What is the javascript run time environment?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A runtime environment is where your program will be executed.</li>
        <li>The JavaScript engine works inside an environment, which provides additional features to your scripts that you can use at runtime.</li>
        <li>JavaScript code may be executed in one of two runtime environments:<br><br>

            <b>1.Browser’s runtime environment:</b>
            Front-end JavaScript applications are executed in a <b>Browser’s runtime environment</b> and have access to the window object.<br><br>

            <n>2.Node runtime environment:</n>
            Back-end JavaScript applications are executed in the <n>Node runtime environment</n> and have access to the file system, databases, and networks attached to the server.
    </ul>


    <h3>Q3. What is execution context?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Execution context is basically abstract concept of an environment where the Javascript code is evaluated and executed. Whenever any code is run in JavaScript, it’s run inside an execution context.</li>
        <li>There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:</li><br><br>
        <b>1.Global Execution Context (GEC):</b>
        Whenever the JavaScript engine receives a script file, it first creates a default Execution Context known as the Global Execution Context (GEC).
        The GEC is the base/default Execution Context where all JavaScript code that is not inside of a function gets executed.
        For every JavaScript file, there can only be one GEC.<br><br>
        <n>2.Function Execution Context (FEC):</n>
        Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a different type of Execution Context known as a Function Execution Context (FEC) within the GEC to evaluate and execute the code within that function.
        Since every function call gets its own FEC, there can be more than one FEC in the run-time of a script.
    </ul>


    <h3>Q4. What is javascript Engine?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is not understandable by computer but the only browser understands JavaScript. 
            So, we need a program to convert our JavaScript program into computer-understandable language. 
            Hence, A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language.
            </li>
            <li>They convert the high level code into machine-readable code which lets computer to perform some specific tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>Q5. What is flow of data in engine?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Data flow means flow of data between origin to destination.The environment needs to have an engine, which takes the JS code that's written in human-readable syntax and turns it into machine code.</li>
    </ul>
